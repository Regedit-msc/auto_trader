# Generates buy signals when the short-term moving average crosses above the long-term moving average.
# RSIStrategy
# Generates buy signals for oversold conditions based on the Relative Strength Index (RSI).
# Breakout Strategy
# Generates buy signals for breakouts above resistance levels.

# Short Trades:
# Mean Reversion Strategy
# Generates sell signals when the price deviates significantly from its mean based on historical data.
# MACD Strategy
# Generates sell signals when the MACD line crosses below the signal line.
# Breakout Strategy
# Generates sell signals for breakouts below support levels.

# Any Trades:
# Market Making Strategy
# Provides liquidity to the market by placing both buy and sell orders around the current market price.
# Arbitrage Strategy
# Exploits price discrepancies between different markets or exchanges to profit regardless of trade direction.
# This categorization is based on the primary trade direction each strategy aims to capture. Long trade strategies focus on identifying opportunities to enter buy positions, while short trade strategies focus on entering sell positions. Strategies categorized under "Any Trades" are not inherently biased towards a specific trade direction and can be applied regardless of whether the trade is long or short.
